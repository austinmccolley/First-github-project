        <h1>Heading One</h1>
        <h2>Heading Two</h2>
        <h3>Heading Three</h3>
        <h4>Heading Four</h4>
        <h5>Heading Five</h5>
        <h6>Heading Six</h6>

        <!-- Paragraph -->
        <p>
            <em>Paragraph</em> goes here. or sentence.
             It seems in visual studio 
            the txts do not go to the next line. It 
            will just keep going 
            like in excell. You have to press enter to 
            go to the next line.
            Need to go through this again later 
            after ive figured out how 
            or if i can change the 
            settings so that words stay on the page.
            seems a silly feature for this but what 
            the fuck do i know.
            The first link will be 
            <a href="http://google.com">google</a>
            The second link will open a new
             <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">tab.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Is double spacing the lines in betwee
            n the paragraphs going to make it look
              goofy on the web? Suppose I should make a 
            single spaced one after I finish this one. I
             dont think im going to go back through 
             here and fix the grammer.
        </p><p>
            This is single spaced. <strong>Nevermind,
            </strong> be linking documents
            not typing essays on here. This isnt
             microsoft word. How many
            Lines should paragraphs be? I think 
            this is enough.
